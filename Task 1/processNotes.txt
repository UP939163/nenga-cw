1. Import data to MatLab
2. Normalise data in range 0-1
3. Format data for processing (Convert to vectors?)
4. Randomise data order to avoid over-fitting
5. Create network
  a. Activation functions (Sigmoid and Softmax)
  b. Cost function (Cross-entropy)
  c. Random weights (and bias nodes set to 1)
6. Backpropagation
  a. Can MatLab do this for us? I'm not entirely convinced
  b. Derivatives of just about everything
